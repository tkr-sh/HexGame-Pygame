## Whats is Hex ?
### Historical point of view
-----
Hex as been created in 1942 by a Danish mathematician named _Piet Hein_. The first commercialization of this game is in 1952. With time, some strategies to win have been seeking. Thus, techniques have been found to consistently win on a 7x7 and 9x9 Board. More recently, in 2019, Facebook succeeds in beating the best player of Hex on a 19x19 board.
### What Are the rules of this game ?
---
First, Hex is a two player game. It's a strategic and abstract board game. Each players have a color, black and white. The cells of the board are made up of hexagons. Hence the name "Hex".The goal for each player is to form a connected path of their stones linking the opposing sides of the board marked by their colors before their opponent similarly connects his or her sides.

_Illustration from the Game_

In this example, white won because they form a line that is linking the opposite white side. Traditionally, board measure 9x9, 11x11, 13x13 or 17x17. 

### Some Strategies and tips
---
#### **Easy and Faster connections**
Usually, beginners place their pawns directly next to them to create a connection. But there is a faster way to proceed. If you have 2 pawns that have 2 hexagons in common (1), they can be connected, even if black put a Hexagon in one of them (2) > (3). Example:

#### **Stopping a pawn**

Imagine playing black and being in this situation:

How can you stop white ?
First play a pawn in front of white's pawn.

Now that you are in this position you must put white in a situation where they must play near your pion, by playing like that:

## The program
### The algorithm for the Win
---
How can the algorithm detect if a player has won ?

#### **Step 1:**
If there is a pawn on the first line, it would be marked as "solution pawn".
If there is no pawn on this line, then, the player can't win

#### **Step 2:**
All pawns connected to a solution Pawn becomes Solution pawn. But when a Solution Pawn makes a non-solution pawn to become a solution, then this pawn becomes "past". A past pawn can't be a solution pawn anymore.

#### **Step 3:**
If a solution pawn is on the last line, the player won.
